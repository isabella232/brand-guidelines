                    <h1>Rancher Labs Trademarks</h1>
                    <p>Rancher Labs has two U.S. trademark registrations – one for the RANCHER word mark and another for the cow logo.</p>
                    <p>The RANCHER and Cow Logo marks are listed on the Principal Register of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
                    <p>The marks are registered for the following goods and services:</p>
                    <p class="ml-40"><em>"Computer software for use in developing, deploying, distributing and managing other computer software,· computer software for use in automating the development, distribution and management of containerized computer program applications and for executing computer program applications using containerization; computer software/or creating, configuring, managing, deploying and delivering cloud computing infrastructure services,· computer operating programs and computer operating systems" in Class 9; and
  "Computer software implementation services; computer software configuration services; computer software integration services; computer systems integration services; technical support services, namely, troubleshooting of software problems" in Class 42.</em></p>

                        <h3>Proper Trademark Use</h3>
                        <p>To build strong rights in the RANCHER and Cow Logo trademarks, it is necessary to continue use of the marks in a distinctive manner. Rancher Labs trademark claims are established by proper and extensive usage of the marks. It is important that any advertising and promotional materials be reviewed for proper trademark usage to continue building strong trademark rights.</p>
                        <p>Failure to maintain a trademark's distinctiveness may result in the loss of Rancher Labs' trademark rights. Loss of distinctiveness occurs through improper use, improper licensing, or failure to restrain infringement of the marks by others. Rancher Labs' trademark rights can also be jeopardized if we discontinue use of the marks—a trademark may be considered abandoned (and is subject to cancellation) if it is not used for three consecutive years.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-section">
                        <h3>Third Party Use (Licensing and Infringement)</h3>
                        <p>If Rancher Labs intends to expand the use of its trademarks by permitting a third party to use the marks, we should enter into a formal written licensing agreement covering the conditions of use of the marks and establishing our control over the use. The use of trademarks by a third party without a proper written license agreement can jeopardize our registrations and trademark rights by destroying the distinctiveness of our marks.</p>
                        <p>Infringement by others occurs when our marks (or confusingly similar marks) are used by a party which is not licensed to use the marks. It is deemed to occur when a party sells, distributes or advertises goods or services in association with a trademark, service mark, or trade name which is confusingly similar to our marks. If we believe that our marks may be infringed by another party's use, the Rancher Labs legal team should review the third party use and advise about the alternative actions that may be taken.</p>

                    <h2>Trademark Usage Guide</h2>
                    <p>In commerce, individuals and organizations use trademarks and service marks to identify and distinguish its goods and services from those goods and services provided by others. Through the proper usage of marks, consumers come to know that particular quality products and services derive from a single source. Through this means of recognition, individuals and businesses build valuable goodwill with their customers.</p>
                    <p>If a trademark or service mark is not used properly, it no longer serves the trademark function of identifying a single source or origin of the goods or services. If the mark no longer serves its function, the owner loses the goodwill associated with it and the light to exclude others from using the mark. Therefore, it is important for the trademark and service mark owner to ensure that its marks are used correctly.</p>
                    <p>Observation of the following rules will help ensure proper usage of our trademarks and service marks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use a generic name of the product in association with Rancher® software trademark A trademark is not the descriptive name of the product itself because it serves the separate and distinct purpose of identifying the source or origin of the product. Therefore, it is improper and a misuse of the trademark to use it as a noun to describe the product. Generic use of the mark as a noun can jeopardize Rancher Labs’ rights to enforce the mark and care should be taken to ensure its proper use. Use trademarks grammatically as proper adjectives to modify the generic name of the product. The following are examples of correct and incorrect Rancher trademark usage: Correct: Buy Rancher® software. Incorrect: Buy Rancher®. Correct: Rancher® software works fast. Incorrect: Rancher® works fast. Do not pluralize a trademark (that suggests its use as a noun). In addition, do not use a trademark in the possessive.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use a trademark notice Rancher and the cow logo are federally registered marks. Federal law provides three alternate trademark notice versions that can be used for trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The letter R enclosed in a circle --®--</li>
                                <li>"Registered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.”</li>
                                <li>"Reg. U.S. Pat. & Tm.Off." [the abbreviated version of (2)]</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Rancher Labs will typically standardize on option one above for Rancher® software and the cow logo. When the cow logo appears immediately next to the word mark Rancher, use one symbol to refer to the fact that both marks are registered. The ® notice has no prescribed style or size. It can be set in a style of type that harmonizes with the rest of the printed matter and it can be quite small (provided it remains legible). The notice conventionally goes on the “shoulder” of the trademark. However, this can vary since the statutes simply require that the notice appear with the mark as used.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Use a trademark notice in all publications
                            <p>Any product or service manual, brochure, advertisement other publication using the trademark must receive the appropriate trademark symbol (®) on the first occurrence in both the preface and in the text. Any trademarked product name or service that appears on the title page must receive the appropriate symbol both on the title page and on the first occurrence in the preface and in the text. If a trademark notice appears with the first or the most prominent use of the trademark, it is not essential that the notice be repeated each time the trademark is used after that.</p>
                            <p>All content should include a boilerplate which consists of the trademark legend plus the copyright notice. For content first published in 2017, use the following:</p>
                            <p class="text-muted"><em>Rancher and the cow logo are registered trademarks or trademarks of Rancher Labs, Inc. in the United States and other countries.

                            For things like a website where the content is constantly changing and being updated, use a range of years, starting with the year first published:

                        </li>
                        <li>Do not vary the trademark or service mark as a basis for other language forms Changes in the form of a mark dilute and detract from the mark’s status. Variations suggest to the consumer that the mark is just another word that is subject to variation or grammatical manipulation. Do not vary the trademark as a basis for other language forms, including abbreviations or coined words. Do not:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Change the spelling</li>
                                <li>Insert hyphens, or break the trademark at the end of a line</li>
                                <li>Combine Rancher with another word to create one new word</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ol>
